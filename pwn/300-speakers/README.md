# 300 - speakers

## Description

A pretty standard House of Botcake challenge. Hopefully this introduces people in PDX to the heap well.

## Deploy

In `src/`, run `./compile.sh`. Then, the binary is ready to go. Provide `basic-bof` and `Dockerfile` (a way of determining libc version for solvers).

## Challenge

You've proven yourself to be sufficient at stack challenges... but can you solve heap challenges?
