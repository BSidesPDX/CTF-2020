# 100 - speakers-1

## Description

A simple heap overflow challenge.

## Deploy

In `src/`, run `./compile.sh`. Then, the `Dockerfile` is ready to go. Provide `speakers-2` and `Dockerfile` (another way of determining libc version for solvers).

## Challenge

Dang, I still haven't learned not to use `gets`!

...oh btw this time, you gotta find your own libc leak
