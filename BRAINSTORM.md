# Brainstorming

If you have ideas for challenges but haven't decided which ones you want to build, put your ideas here. Maybe someone else will want to build it. If not, we can carry this file on to following years and retain our ideas.

## Remove me before release

Before releasing this repo, we should strip all references to this file from the repo so as not to give away any potential future challenges. See [BFG](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) for information on how to do this.

## Ideas
* A challenge that requires connecting to a gopher server
* Can we use UUCP for a challenge? It's a nice, old, obscure protocol.
* Put finger on the internet, player has to finger <user>@<challengedomain>.bsidespdx.party in order to get the next step (or maybe player gets the flag at this step and there are other steps to find the user name)
