# 200 - Name Unknown

(This is a challenge that doesn't have a name yet)

## Description

A strange signal has interrupted your regularly scheduled programming and the sound of a child is reading out random hexadecimal digits. If you can catch all the digits, you'll need to figure out how to decrypt it using the secret key. I've heard it's pretty xclusive. (XOR Key is provided in audio, known flag prefix should make it obvious).

## Deploy

All challenges in the Over The Air category are deployed to an OCI instance streaming to twitch.tv. Individual challenges will also have the relevant sections cut and made available individually after the challenge is over (or if we need to make it easier for people)

## Challenge

I was watching my regularly scheduled state sponsored programming when I got some strange interference. It sounded like a little girl was talking to me but I couldn't understand what she was saying. Can you figure it out?
