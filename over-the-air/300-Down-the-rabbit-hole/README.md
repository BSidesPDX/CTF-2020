# 300 - Down the rabbit hole

## Description

During one of the commercial breaks, once again the signal is interrupted. This time, by a woman wearing a facemask which has a scrolling hex value and some tones play over the video. The tones are DTMF dial tones, which when decoded give a phone number. If that phone number is called, an automated system reqeuests a 5 digit message code. The code is the decimal value of the scrolling hex in the original video. Once that code is input, a morse code message plays. This message gives a 2nd message code. When the phone number is once again called with this new message code, a URL is given, which leads to a YouTube video. During the YouTube video, more interference occurs, but this time it's a SSTV signal. The flag is contained within the resulting image.

## Deploy

All challenges in the Over The Air category are deployed to an OCI instance streaming to twitch.tv. Individual challenges will also have the relevant sections cut and made available individually after the challenge is over (or if we need to make it easier for people)

## Challenge

During one of the commercial breaks of my favorite state sponsored educational video, there was some interference once again. There was a woman wearing some sort of facemasl and there were strange tones. The tones were familiar and rang a bell, but I couldn't quite put my finger on them. I don't know what these things mean, but maybe you can figure it out.
