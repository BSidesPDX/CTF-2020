# 100 - Please Stand By

## Description

Between tv shows, the station turns off, showing instead a simple test pattern. Well our test pattern has a secret, and it takes the form of QR codes. The sasquatch faces the side of the screen that the next QR code quarter will turn up. Screenshot each section of the QR code and then reassemble in the correct order for the flag.

## Deploy

All challenges in the Over The Air category are deployed to an OCI instance streaming to twitch.tv. Individual challenges will also have the relevant sections cut and made available individually after the challenge is over (or if we need to make it easier for people)

## Challenge

Sometimes I like to tune into the TV when no shows are on so I can watch the test pattern. I like to believe that there's a secret message hidden in the transmission.
